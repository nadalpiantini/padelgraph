/**

 * Swiss System Rules:
 * - Fixed number of rounds (typically 5-7)
 * - Players with same score paired together
 * - Avoid repeat pairings when possible
 * - No elimination - everyone plays all rounds
 * - Final ranking by total points + tiebreakers
 *
 * Pairing Methods:
 * - Slide: Top half vs bottom half within score group
 * - Fold: Adjacent pairing (1v2, 3v4, 5v6) within score group
 * - Accelerated: Spread top players early to avoid early clashes
