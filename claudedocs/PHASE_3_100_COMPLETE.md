    {
      "path": "/api/cron/check-in-reminders",
      "schedule": "0 * * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/calculate-stats",
      "schedule": "0 2 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/sync-subscriptions",
      "schedule": "0 3 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/update-leaderboards",
      "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/retry-failed-payments",
      "schedule": "0 4 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/reset-usage",
      "schedule": "0 0 1 * *"
